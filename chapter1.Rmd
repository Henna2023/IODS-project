# About the project

*I am very interested to learn R better as my current expertise is at an intro level. Also, a bit overwhelmed with all the different platforms, codes and functions in R. Hopefully, things get easier as I make progress with the course and maybe there are some similarities in the functionality of R with other tools that I am more familiar with. 

The R for Health Data Science and the Exercise 1 provide quite a good learning tool given clear explanations and learning-by-doing approach. The functionality of R with building different kind of graphs seems very useful compared to some other tools. The first four chapters of the book provide a good basics of using R, but I am particularly interested to make progress towards more analytical work with R.
