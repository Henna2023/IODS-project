# Both BPRS and RATS data sets include repeated measures data where a response variable is recorded several times over some period of time. Thus, these represent longitudinal data sets.

# BPRS includes data for 40 male subjects that were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups and each subject was rated on the brief psychiatric rating scale (BPRS) measured before treatment began (week 0) and then at weekly intervals for eight weeks. 
# Data assesses the level of 18 symptom constructs rated from one (not present) to seven (extremely severe). The study is focus on presence of schizophrenia.

# BPRS data set includes 40 observations of 11 variables. 
# - Treatment variable indicates assignment to one of two treatment groups
# - Subject refers to the male subjects that are studied. There are 20 subjects in each treatment group.
# - Rest of the variables include BPRS assessments measured each week for 8 weeks with week0 indicating the baseline.

# RATS includes data from a nutrition study conducted in three groups of rats. The three groups were put on different diets. 
# Each ratâ€™s body weight (grams) was recorded repeatedly (approximately weekly, except in week seven when two recordings were taken). 
# Overall, the study time period was 9 weeks.
