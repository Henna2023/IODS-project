# Regression model for exam points. 

# As the first run of the regression model with 3 explanatory variables, I choose attitude, surface and strategy for the regression 

model_points1 <- lm(points ~ attitude + stra + surf, data = students2014)

#printing the output of the regression model
model_points1
summary(model_points1)

# Results of the first regression shows that attitude is statistically significant in explaining exam results. Strategy has some significance (t statistic 1.6) while surface is not significant. Statistical significance is evaluated by looking at the t values and P(>|t|) of the regression output. 

# R-squared for the model1 is 0.193. Thus the three chosen variables explain less than 20 percent of the variability of exam points.

# The second regression takes out surf variable and adds age. The three explanatory variables are attitude, strategy and age.
model_points2 <- lm(points ~ attitude + stra + age, data = students2014)

#printing the output of the regression model
model_points2
summary(model_points2)


# Results of the second regression are better compared to first. Attitude is still statistically significant with t value of 6.1. This means that the hypothesis that the coefficient for attitude is zero can be rejected with high confidence. Strategy and age have moderate t values and can be rejected to be zero at somewhat lower 90 percent confidence.

# R-squared for the model2 is somewhat higher compared to the first regression at 0.204.

# Based on the regression output, one point higher attitude score would be expected to correspond to about 3.5 higher exam point, one point higher strategy score would correspond to 1.0 higher exam points, and one additional year of age would correspond to lower exam points by 0.1, thus marginally.

# Additionally, according to the regression results an average student for all the variables would be expected to have 22.7 exam points. An example student that performs one standard deviation above the mean across the variables would have an estimated exam points of 25.3. It should be noted this may not be a good illustration of a higher performing students as it assumes comparable high performance across all the three explanatory variables. An example student that performs one standard deviation below the mean across the variables would have an estimated exam points of 20.1.

#Part 5 of Assingment 2

# Diagnostic test are done with different regression diagnostic plots: regression vs fitted values, normal QQ-plot and residuals vs leverage.

plot(model_points2)

# Residuals vs fitted values can be used to detect non-linearities, outliers or non-constant error variance. The scatter plot suggests that the residuals are scattered around 0 fairly randomly (linear relationship likely reasonable assumption) and there doesn't seem to be patterns suggesting changing error variance. However, there seems to be a few outliers with large negative residuals.

# Normal QQ-plot is used to assess if the residuals are normally distributed. If this is the case, the data points of the QQ-plot should be fairly closely aligned with a straight 45 degree line. Low and to extent high values for residuals seem to be off the straight line, suggesting that there may be a problem of outliers or fat-tails. 

# Residuals vs levarage can be used to checked whether there are influential cases as not all outliers necessarily impact the regression line significantly. There doesn't see to be residuals to that breach the Cook's line (indication that there would be leverage)
